# analyzing_marketing_campaigns_python

In this notebook we have analyzed a marketing campaign from start to finish. 

In Preprocessing there is some feature engineering by creating new columns

Marketing metrics were then looked at like conversion and retention rates.

Customer segmentation was then looked i.e. how different marketing channels reach different age groups.

We dealt with one of the most common challenges in marketing which is to detect when something went wrong in the campaign.The mistake was the language mismatch between language preferred by user and the language in which ad was displayed.

Lastly, we analyzed a simple A/B test
We saw how to determine statistical significance and the importance of segmentation in A/B tests to understand the true impact of the change.
